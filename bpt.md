# Setting up the beat pilot tone system

## Hardware

Run the longer cable from the cabinet room, through the waveguide into the scanner room, and then back out the other waveguide into the scanner console room. Attach one end of this cable to the spare 10 MHz connection in the cabinet that holds the MARS and other compute hardware.

Clamp the antenna to the MR-compatible pole, and locate/orient the antenna as needed in the room. Run the wire from the antenna back out the waveguide to the console room.
